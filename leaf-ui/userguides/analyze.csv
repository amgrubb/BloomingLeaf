2a,, Analyze model,, `Once you have created your model, click the analysis button to analyze potential outcomes over time. Analysis mode allows you to visualize potential outcomes of the model over time. Based on the number of timepoints and constraints you choose, analysis mode will assign satisfaction values to each intention for each timepoint.`,, "Placeholder"
2b,, Choose conflict prevention level,, `Choose a level from the dropdown to determine how many conflicting satisfaction values can be present in the model. “Strong” indicates that the model will try to avoid any conflicting satisfaction values and “None” indicates that the model will not do anything to avoid conflicting satisfaction values. To see more information about conflicting satisfaction values, see the documentation document in the documentation dropdown.`,, "Placeholder"
2c,, Specify number of timepoints,, `To specify the number of timepoints you would like to see in analysis, click the text box with “1” in it and then either type in your desired number of states or click the up and down arrows to increment the number of states by one. The number of states you select will determine the number of possible outcomes of your model you are presented with.`,, "Placeholder"
2d,, Simulate path,, `Once you have chosen your conflict prevention level and number of time points, click the “Simulate Path” button to display the outcome of analysis. Once the path is simulated, you will be presented with your model at the final time point with randomly assigned satisfaction values. To see other potential outcomes, move the slider on the bottom of the page left to see previous outcomes and right to see the next potential outcomes.`,, "Placeholder"
2e,, EVO,, `To make it easier to see when intentions have which satisfaction values, you may choose to use EVO mode. Nodes will change colors based on their satisfaction values. <ul><li>Slide the slider in the toolbar to %, Time, or State</li><li>% mode shows the node divided into colors based on the number of timepoints for which it is a given satisfaction value, grouped by most satisfied on the left and least satisfied on the right</li><li>Time mode shows the node divided into colors based on the how its satisfaction value changes over time, from left to right as it moves through time</li><li>State mode shows the node’s satisfaction value at the given state currently represented by the slider</li><li>Change the color palette using the EVO dropdown in the toolbar</li></ul>`,, "placeholder"
2f,, Further analysis,, `You can also create multiple results and multiple analysis requests. Different analysis requests can have different specifications, such as a different number of relative time points, while results within a request are different randomized simulations run within the same constraints.<ul><li>Click the “+” button next to Analysis on the left inspector to create a new analysis</li><li>Modify the number of relative time points</li><li>Click Simulate path as many times as you would like to create results within the request</li><li>Click on results in the pane to the left to view past results</li><li>Click the trash icon to remove an analysis request</li></ul>`,, "placeholder"
