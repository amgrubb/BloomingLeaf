# BloomingLeaf
BloomingLeaf is a web-based tool for modeling and analyzing (Tropos like) formal goal models with evolving intentions. 

This project is part of @amgrubb's [PhD Thesis](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amgrubb/thesis).

## Goals
1. Enable modeling of goals with evolving intentions/goals.
2. Enable simulation of goal models as intentions evolve.
3. Enable stakeholders to ask time-based trade-off questions in early-phase requirements engineering.
